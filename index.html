          <p>How does javaScript work?</p>
        </div>

            JavaScript is a client side scripting language. It means JavaScript
            runs at the client-side, inside the web-browsers. help of javaScript
            Engine. So most important thing to remember is that the clients
            web-browser also needs to support the JavaScript. Now most of the
            web browsers support JavaScript and have there JavaScript engines.
          </p>
          <h4>Example:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Google Chrome has its own JavaScript engine called V8.</li>
            <li>Firefox Spidermonkey.</li>
            <li>Safari JavaScript Core</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Also JavaScript is single-threaded language it means JavaScript run
            only one operation at a time. But there has event loop which
            maintain long task.
          </p>
          <p>
            Conclusion: JavaScript work help of javaScript Engine (V8,
            Spidermonkey) Line by line synchronously.

          <p>what is javaScript event loop?</p>

            Javascript is single-threaded, it executes only one operation at a
            time. This process of executing we say javascript is synchronous and
            run only one operation at a time. But what happens when run long
            task to complete? This situation JavaScript complete long task help
            of event loop. behind the seans which mechanisms complete there long
            task called event loop. Now we discous this mechanisms (event loop).
          </p>
          <h4>JavaScript Engine</h4>
          <p>
            Each browser has a Javascript runtime environment. the javascript
            runtime consists of Javascript Engine. this engine have a memory
            heap and a call stack.
          </p>
          <h4>Heap</h4>
          <p>
            Memory heap is allocated every objects, functions or variables and
            stored in the heap.(means top).
          </p>
          <h4>Call stack</h4>
          <p>
            The call stack read your javascript code and executed line by
            line.The call stack follows the First In Last principle, the
            function that is first added is executed last.

            SessionStorage and LocalStorage used for storing the data on the
            client side. But there have some differences between local storage
            and session storage are given bellow:

                  The session storage Stores data only for the duration of the
                  session, when the user closes their browser the data is lost.

                <td>
                  The session storage data Cleared when browser closed.and there

                  The local storage data limit 5MB per app per browser.
                  According to the HTML5 spec, this limit can be increased by
                  the user when needed.
